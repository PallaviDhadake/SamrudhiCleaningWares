As a group we have always adhered to our ethos of ingrained value systems, good business practices and total transparency in all our deals.

Or, the unwavering commitment of each individual to deliver beyond expectations? Or, was it the foresight of our torchbearers? I would like to say that it has been a combination of all the above and more.
